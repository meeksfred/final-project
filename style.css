/*
this css will be for the top of the page. It will include very brief instructions
(in large which Helvetica) for the user which are framed in front of a background
photo of Seattle.
Once the user starts scrolling down, an event listener is called and the navigation bar appears and lets a user return home, or go to another page of the site.
Below the main section is the actual program to let a user select a neighborhood
and view attractions.
